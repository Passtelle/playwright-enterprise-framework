## 👋 About Me

Senior QA Engineer with 10+ years of enterprise experience at IBM Internet Security Systems and Fiserv, where I tested security products against real threats and owned QA for regulated financial platforms. I introduced security testing where it didn't exist, led an offshore QA team, and built test infrastructure from scratch in regulated environments.

I independently designed and built this portfolio from scratch using Playwright, TypeScript, GitHub Actions CI/CD, Jira/Xray, and a multi-agent LLM workflow, directing Claude Code and Gemini to generate, audit, and validate test automation across UI, API, and security layers.

Conceived and designed **DigitPilot** ([digitpilot.io](https://digitpilot.io)), a digital-asset education platform: built the product structure and interactive prototypes using Figma AI, incorporating personal Blockchain/Web3 domain knowledge and turning personal market experience into a structured learning concept and website.

**Looking for:** Senior QA Engineer roles at FinTech, blockchain, or AI-driven companies. Hybrid or remote.

## 🎯 What This Project Demonstrates

| Skill | How It's Demonstrated |
|-------|----------------------|
| **E2E Test Automation** | SecureBank banking flow: login, deposit, balance verified in CI |
| **API Testing** | DummyJSON: 4 layers (happy / negative / boundary / security) in Postman + Playwright TypeScript |
| **CI/CD Pipeline** | GitHub Actions: push, test, JUnit XML, Xray upload, Jira updated automatically |
| **Page Object Model** | 17 POMs across banking, e-commerce, booking, and API test apps |
| **AI-Augmented QA** | Claude Code + Gemini Judge + GitHub Copilot multi-agent orchestration |
| **Test Management** | Jira/Xray: Gherkin BDD test cases linked to live CI executions |
| **Security Testing Mindset** | SQL injection, boundary analysis, auth token validation in API suite |

---

## 🏦 Portfolio Centerpiece: SecureBank E2E Suite

Full end-to-end banking flow running automatically on every push:

```
Push to GitHub
     ↓
GitHub Actions triggers
     ↓
Playwright runs SecureBank E2E (login → deposit → balance verified)
     ↓
JUnit XML generated
     ↓
Xray API upload → Test Execution auto-created in Jira BAS project
```

**3 Page Object Models built for this suite:**

```
pages/
├── SecureBankLoginPage.ts       → All Gold locators (data-testid)
├── SecureBankDashboardPage.ts   → Reads live balance and account stats
└── SecureBankTransactionPage.ts → Handles Radix UI comboboxes (click + getByRole)
```

Key technical decisions:
- Radix UI custom dropdowns require `.click()` then `getByRole('option')`, not `selectOption()`
- Dynamic account IDs fixed with `selectOption({ label: /Primary Savings/ })`, RegExp partial match stable after every deposit
- Client-side SPA navigation used for balance check, preserves React state vs hard reload

## 🧪 Test Suites

### UI Testing: SecureBank Banking App

| Test | Type | Status |
|------|------|--------|
| Login + deposit updates total balance | E2E Happy Path | ✅ Passing in CI |
| Submit deposit with empty amount shows validation error | E2E Negative Path | ✅ Passing in CI |

**Site:** [qaplayground.com/bank](https://www.qaplayground.com/bank), a Next.js banking simulation with real `data-testid` attributes throughout.

### API Testing: DummyJSON

| Test File | Layer | What It Covers |
|-----------|-------|----------------|
| `BAS-4-auth-happy-path.spec.ts` | Happy Path | POST /auth/login → 200 + accessToken |
| `BAS-9-auth-missing-password.spec.ts` | Negative | Empty password → 400 |
| `BAS-10-auth-boundary-username.spec.ts` | Boundary | 128-char username via `'a'.repeat(128)` |
| `BAS-6-auth-sql-injection.spec.ts` | Security | SQL injection → no auth bypass, no 500 error |

All 4 layers covered: Happy Path, Negative, Boundary, Security. Designed to mirror the enterprise API coverage approach used at IBM and Fiserv.

---

## ⚙️ CI/CD Pipeline

Every push to `main` triggers the full pipeline:

```yaml
on: push (main)
  → npm ci
  → npx playwright install --with-deps
  → Run SecureBank E2E (Chromium)
  → Generate JUnit XML report
  → Upload results to Xray Cloud API
  → Test Execution auto-created in Jira BAS project
```

Credentials managed via GitHub Secrets. Never exposed in source code.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Category | Tools |
|----------|-------|
| **Test Automation** | Playwright 1.58.1, TypeScript (strict mode) |
| **API Testing** | Postman, DummyJSON, Playwright `request` fixture |
| **Test Data** | Faker.js, dynamic data, never hardcoded |
| **CI/CD** | GitHub Actions |
| **Test Management** | Jira, Xray (BDD/Gherkin + JUnit XML import) |
| **AI Tools** | Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Gemini (Judge LLM) |
| **Security** | dotenv, credentials always in secrets vault |

## 📐 Coding Standards

All code follows strict standards documented in [`CLAUDE.md`](./CLAUDE.md):

- **No `any` type**, explicit TypeScript types everywhere
- **No hardcoded timeouts**, state-based waits only (`waitFor`, `toBeVisible`)
- **No assertions in POMs**, POMs act, tests assert
- **Locator priority**: Gold (`data-testid`) > Silver (`getByRole`) > Bronze (`getByPlaceholder`)
- **RegExp with `/i` flag** for all text assertions, never exact string matching
- **Explicit method parameters**, no optional defaults hiding test intent
- **3-section test structure**: `// THE PLAN / THE WORK / THE CHECK`

Every AI-generated file passes a three-role audit before merge:
1. **Claude Code** implements following CLAUDE.md standards
2. **Gemini** independent auditor, flags violations
3. **Human Architect** final approval

15 real audit lessons documented in [`QA_AUDIT_LESSONS.md`](./QA_AUDIT_LESSONS.md).
